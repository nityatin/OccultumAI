The dark stars would be composed mostly of normal matter, like modern stars, but a high concentration of neutralino dark matter present within them would generate heat via annihilation reactions between the dark-matter particles. This heat would prevent such stars from collapsing into the relatively compact and dense sizes of modern stars and therefore prevent nuclear fusion among the 'normal' matter atoms from being initiated.[1]

Under this model, a dark star is predicted to be an enormous cloud of molecular hydrogen and helium ranging between 1 and 960 astronomical units (AU) in radius; its surface temperature would be around 10000 K. It is expected that they would grow over time and reach masses up to 
10
6
{\displaystyle 10^{6}}M☉, up until the point where they exhaust the dark matter needed to sustain them, after which they would collapse.[1][2][3]

In the unlikely event that dark stars have endured to the modern era, they could be detectable by their emissions of gamma rays, neutrinos, and antimatter and would be associated with clouds of cold molecular hydrogen gas that normally would not harbor such energetic, extreme, and rare particles.[4][2]
